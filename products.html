                <p>The lowest emission values were recorded in the eastern part of the Eastern Desert of Beni Suef Governorate and in the Western Desert, due to the absence of human activities, industries, or any sources of fossil fuel combustion, at a rate of 6.83399 mol/m². Conversely, the highest value was recorded in New Beni Suef City, east of Old Beni Suef City, due to the presence of cement factories and medical incinerators in the village of Sanur, at a rate of 0.000193593 mol/m²....</p>

                <h2>Rains</h2>
                <p>The amount of rainfall in Beni Suef Governorate increases in the northwest part, ranging from 6.35 to 7.57 millimeters, and gradually decreases towards the southeast, reaching its lowest amount at 2.65 to 3.89 millimeters. Rainfall is influenced by air pollutants, forming various compounds, with one of the most impactful being the mixing of rain with NO2 pollutants, forming nitric acid. The highest NO2 pollutant value was recorded in New Beni Suef City, east of the old city, due to the presence of cement factories and medical incinerators in the village of Sanur, at a rate of 0.000193593 moles/m2. This results in a type of rain called acid rain, which falls on the large and final ranks located in the eastern desert, flowing into the middle of the Nile River....</p>

                <h2>Winds</h2>
                <p>The wind is influenced by air pollutants present in the governorate, affecting the direction of NO2 pollutants, which impacts the residents of the following centers: Biba, Samasta, and Al-Fashn. The wind also affects the direction of SO2 pollutants, which increase in urban areas, thus carrying SO2 to the surrounding rural areas. The wind impacts formaldehyde pollutants found in large quantities in the capitals of the following centers: Beni Suef, Nasser, and Al-Wasta, directing these pollutants to the southern centers (Biba, Samasta, Al-Fashn). The wind affects the direction of O3 pollutants, carrying them from the north in Al-Wasta, Nasser, and Beni Suef centers (the most polluted by O3) to the southwest, impacting Ihnasia, Biba, and Samasta centers. The wind carries CO pollutants from the northwestern part of the Eastern Desert to the southwestern part, slightly affecting Biba and Al-Fashn centers. The wind also influences the direction of aerosol pollutants, carrying them from the Eastern Desert and significantly affecting all centers, as they lie on fertile Nile floodplain soil, which is predominantly agricultural and has lower aerosol concentrations....</p>
